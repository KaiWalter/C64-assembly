# C64 Assembler samples

C64 assembly sample programs to learn 6502 assembly and the capabilities of the C64U.

The first batch of samples is copied over from <https://github.com/nealvis/c64_samples_kick>.

## Running C64U

When using **KickAss** VS Code extension, `.prg` is usually launched within **VICE**.

Script `run64u.ps1` obtains C64 hostname and network password with 1Password CLI and sends a `.prg` file for execution on the C64 Ultimate.
